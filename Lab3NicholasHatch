// write a code to calculate coumpound interest using variable P(initial value),t(time),r(interest rate), and A(total amount calculated)

import java.util.Scanner; // imports our scanner class, this is going to allow user input

public class Lab3NicholasHatch
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
{
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // creates our scanner, system.in means it will read what is input by the user

double principal; //initial value
int time;
double rate;
double total;
// declared our variable above. Used double and int the declare them
System.out.println("Please input the principal (inital value)");
// This is prompting our user to input thier initial value
principal = input.nextDouble();
// above sets our principal equal to what is input by the user
System.out.println("Please input the time in years");
// Prompts user to enter the time in years
time = input.nextInt();
// sets what the user inputs equal to time
System.out.println("Please provide the rate");
// asking user to enter the rate
rate = input.nextDouble();
// sets rate equal to what our user inputs
rate = rate / 100;
// turns our provided rate to into a decimal
total = principal * Math.pow ((1 + rate) , time);
// our equation to calculate compound interest
System.out.println("The total after " +  time  + " years is " +  total);
System.out.println("The amount of interest earned is: "  + (total - principal));
// String concatenation to display our results in a sentence
// first print statement shows the total amount after interest is calculated
// second print statement minuses the principal from the calculated total to show how much interest has accumilated
